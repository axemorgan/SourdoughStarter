# Sourdough Starter
A starter culture for Android Projects :bread:

### Kotlin
* Kotlin and Java 8 pre-configured
* Kotlin build scripts and `buildSrc` dependency management (with autocomplete)
* Kotlin Android Extensions and kapt plugins applied

### AndroidX
* AndroidX and Jetifier already enabled
* A selection of common AndroidX dependencies (recycler view, constraint layout, view model, etc.) easily included

### Dagger Android
* Ready made `Application` subclass and an AppComponent to inject it
* Activity and Fragment scopes
* An example `Activity` and `Fragment` injected using Dagger Android
* Useful base classes for Activites and Fragments that perform injection automatically

### Misc
* A .gitignore file for Android Studio projects
