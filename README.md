# Sourdough Starter
A starter culture for Android Projects :bread:

Instead of cloning or forking this repo, use it as a [template](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template) instead.  



### Kotlin
* Kotlin and Java 8 pre-configured
* Kotlin build scripts and `buildSrc` dependency management (with autocomplete)
* Kotlin Android Extensions and kapt plugins applied

### AndroidX
* AndroidX and Jetifier already enabled
* A selection of common AndroidX dependencies (recycler view, constraint layout, view model, etc.) easily included

### Dagger Android
* Ready made `Application` subclass and an AppComponent to inject it
* Activity and Fragment scopes
* An example `Activity` and `Fragment` injected using Dagger Android
* Useful base classes for Activites and Fragments that perform injection automatically
* Support for binding and injecting `ViewModels` built-in
* Application Context already bound in the Dagger graph 

### Misc
* A .gitignore file for Android Studio projects
